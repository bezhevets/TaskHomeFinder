Sign me up!\r\n\r\nThe Lifestyle:\r\nThere's so much natural beauty to discover and a winter creek coursing through the gully, with paddocks and towering trees flowering with the change of seasons. Visiting birdlife in abundance and the odd kangaroo or two - you asked for a home among the gum trees!\r\n\r\nThe residence itself sits perched in an elevated position which complements it's surroundings and capitalises on the aspects on offer, with extensive sealed parking space and verandahs for enjoying the life outdoors on your acreage.\r\n\r\nAs you enter the home you're greeted by an expansively open-planned living area comprising the kitchen and meals area plus lounge, this space is flooded with natural light bouncing off the solid timber floors and has easy access to the patio. Of course this harmonious hub of the home includes the acreage essential - a slow combustion wood fireplace as the centrepiece.\r\n\r\nThe accommodations are positioned on the eastern side of the home and are sheltered from the sun, with 3 generous bedrooms complete with robe storage and a recently refurbished bathroom boasting floor to ceiling tiles and frameless shower. \r\n\r\nUnder the gabled patio which wraps further around western side of the home - you've got the ideal space to share and soak up the serenity with friends and loved ones, cooking outdoors on the bbq or firing up the chiminea for hours of fellowship in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe property features:\r\nThere's no getting around the arguable 'most important' feature of acreage life - the sheds.\r\nYou're spoiled once again here with nearly 160 sqm of covered workspace, a shed and massive lean-to which are connected with ample storage, parking and powered workshop - so yes, you can certainly bring the toys.\r\n\r\nAccess is a breeze with loads of gravel driveway, hardstand and the ability to get around every corner of the block with room for the caravan, boat etc. You won't have any dramas moving around, there's gentle undulation and it's not a 'steep' block despite the hills location.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a number of interconnected paddocks which can be further divided if necessary, plenty of shade trees and of course the winter creek. Bring a sheep or 3, battle supermarket inflation with some chooks of your own, grown your own veges and drink from the clouds - this is your chance to make a move to the 'Good Life'.\r\n\r\nWhat next!?\r\nThere's unspeakable value on offer here, so much so you'll be left scratching your head on replacement cost alone. The ever-popular location offers easy commuting distance and with school bus services delivering kids to a myriad of local schools, Byford shopping only 12 minutes drive, there's so many more reasons to make Serpentine your home.\r\n\r\nUse the 'Email Agent' feature of this webpage to contact Serpentine's own property specialists, the Miles Walton team from Acton Belle Property - and we will be in touch to arrange a suitable time to show you your new lifestyle in Serpentine.",
