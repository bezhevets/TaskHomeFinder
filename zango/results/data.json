Old world charm has been beautifully preserved while a gorgeous renovation and extension, has created a contemporary array of spaces, fit for the evolving needs of modern family life.The light brick exterior is classic to the area, the home hidden by a relaxed swell of garden and hardy lawn.

This flexible space has an enormous built-in-robe and could easily be utilised as a parent's retreat, second living space or third bedroom.The master bedroom lies beyond, occupying the northern tip of the home. A duo of glass pendants frame the bed and softly illuminate the feature wall in soft sage green. A wall of glass sliders captures the stately shape of a towering gum tree, Think, a lovely cuppa on weekend mornings as the light breaks, or drifting deck side for quiet contemplation before the kids wake.There is a large and beautifully appointed walk-in-robe that teems with bespoke cabinetry. The best is saved to last as you merge to a stunning ensuite bathroom. Under lighting softly illuminates the delicate veining of matt ceramics, in hues of grey, as brushed brass fittings gift a threading of gold. Custom made open shelving and wall hung vanity in walnut, anchors the space with earthy warmth. We adore the duo of counter basins in midnight black and the luxury of the huge walk-in-rain shower.The stunning family bathroom is finished in concordant moody hues, with deep floating tub and a frameless glass rain shower. The gorgeous Moroccan mosaic floor tiling in the separate toilet is continued in the adjacent laundry, with its timber benchtop and glass door that opens straight to the garden.One imagines whole summers being spent on the elevated deck with its sheltered alfresco niche.

    "description": "Delightful, Extended Home in a Quiet Family Friendly Street\nA home on a quiet street that delights at first sight with gorgeous street appeal, then totally surprises with a layout that incorporates fabulous interior and outdoor spaces. The moment you step inside and you are greeted by an internal atrium you realise that this is no cookie-cutter floor plan, and as you wander around the home you will discover its easy flow and connected spaces, while offering excellent segregation for family life.To the left of the entry is the segregated main bedroom with built-in wardrobe, updated ensuite, raked ceiling, large north-facing window plus window to the atrium. To the right is the centrally located lounge room which is connected to the dining space, and also open to a sitting area with walls of northerly aspect windows and access to a lovely, privately enclosed front courtyard. The flow then turns to the large dining space which leads to the renovated open kitchen with granite bench tops. A hallway off the kitchen leads to the family bathroom with full-height tiling, and three additional bedrooms with built-in wardrobes. One of these looks out to the atrium while another has lovely dual-aspect windows.Continuing from the kitchen towards the rear of the home you step down and through a glass breezeway to the large and bright family living room with raked ceiling, loads of storage and library shelves. The outdoor space at the rear of the home is something special. The living room flows out to a timber entertaining deck with an awning, from which you step down into the super-private yard with manicured mature plantings and high hedging, paved areas bordering a lawn section, and a beautiful large tree which provides a welcome canopy in the warmer months. Abundant use of glass and a clever floor plan combine to maximise the outlook from inside the home to the foliage that surrounds it, whether in the atrium, the front courtyard or the back gardens.

There are plenty of places to stop and explore and simply enjoy the serenity of life on the waterway. The weir to the rear of the property is an easy, beautiful walk and also makes for a perfect camping ground with the majority of the land being flat here.

    "description": "symmetry of light\nA beautifully balanced floor plan floats two separate social domains among the treetops of old Braddon. Perfectly removed, sheltered by Haig Park, yet moments from the thriving precinct, this gorgeous two-bedroom apartment is punctuated with full height glazing that welcomes natural light. The home spills to private alfresco living on two sides.The northern end of Torrens Street places you at the apex of Braddon and Ainslie. Haig Park buffers the home to the south, gifting a leafy pathway to all the caf\u00e9s, bars and boutique shopping of Braddon. With Ainslie to the east, you are moments from the historic Corroboree Park, Mount Ainslie Reserve and the much-loved Ainslie shops. This is the epitome of peaceful living, right in the heart of the city\u2026you really can ditch the car, with the light rail moments away, whisking you straight to the CBD.The confident geometric shape of the fa\u00e7ade is softened by mature hedges and pretty Japanese maples. There is an inviting symmetry as smooth concrete walls are divided by panes of glass, filling the communal stairwell with golden light.Housed on the second floor, the home is characterised by wide open rooms with floor to ceiling windows, framing peaceful elevated views. White walls coalesce with golden bamboo flooring, as sculptural pendant lighting hangs from high ceilings, lending a feathered airy, softness.The kitchen sits central creating a natural hub that divides the home into symmetrical halves. Finished in natural shades, with pearlescent mosaic splashback and stone benchtops, the space feels effortlessly timeless. Elegant joinery provides ample storage in a mix of drawers and cupboards, including a full-height pantry. Beautifully designed and with quality appliances from Bosch and Fisher & Paykel, the space feels both earthily stylish and hardworking.The master bedroom is housed adjacent to the large front living area, with both rooms drifting to a slender usable balcony that takes in views across the parkland. A clever jack-and-jill bathroom combines a laundry and separate toilet, conveniently accessed from both the bedroom and the living area. Both rooms are a window onto the landscape and combined together create a peaceful parental sanctuary.Doors can be flung open welcoming sunlight and breezes, the second living area combined dining space, spilling from the kitchen and awash with warming north-eastern light. The large outdoor patio, informs and extends the social domain, forging a wonderful connection to outdoors. We love the sheltering wall, with its rectangular cut-out framing the trees and the stand of age-old pine trees that form a natural screen. There is enough space here for a large table, set for plenty, fostering relaxed gatherings in open-air seclusion.The second bedroom is nicely sequestered on the northern side and also drifts to outdoors. This light filled space would also make the perfect home office. Both bedrooms have a wall of built-in-robes for seamless storage and a leafy tree top immersion, creating natural havens that feel both open and deeply private.The apartment is centrally positioned, on the cusp of the city, across from Haig Park and within easy walking distance to the thriving Braddon precinct. Surrounded by green spaces, including the walking and biking trails of Mt Ainslie, the home is also handy to the popular Ainslie shops, home to the award-winning supermarket, Edgar's Gastro Pub and hatted Pilot restaurant. This fantastic inner-north locale, with its mix of independent businesses, green spaces, reserves and proximity to the CBD, places you within easy reach of all the best, that Canberra has to offer.

    "description": "Charming Apartment !\nPlease note that the sellers are looking for a quick sale, as they already have their next home interstate under deposit. So, early inspection is recommended, to avoid disappointment.This three-bedroom, ensuite apartment sits on Level 5 of the North Tower in the Ruby complex. It has been lovingly enhanced by the owners, because until recently they had no plans to move any time soon. Additional downlights have been added in the smaller bedroom, which gives this space the flexibility of being a bedroom, a home office, a study, or a hobby room. Some other nice touches are blue-tooth controlled LED strip lighting along the balcony rail, and USB-A charging ports in some of the power points where it makes sense. Veri Shade blinds installed in the lounge room are both stylish and practical, affording both privacy and clever ways of light filtering. They allow plenty of airflow, when the double balcony doors are opened, and add thermal insulation, when the balcony doors are closed. Something you may wish to see for yourself, in order to fully appreciate it, is the Tansel stainless steel pull-out storage in the pantry, under the kitchen sink, and in the walk-in robe. If you are a foodie, or just someone who appreciates smart storage solutions, be warned that you might fall in love with this kitchen.There are loads of features here which you would probably expect in a modern apartment of this size, like mirrored built-in robes, a walk-in robe in the master suite, double glazing throughout, and a waterfall kitchen bench. But, there are some other things here which are less common, like an entry passage, an entrance closet which is perfect for the family shoes or personal shoe collection, no neighbours on one side of the car spaces, and a separate ducted space for a clothes dryer.Both washrooms include floor-to-ceiling tiles, wall-hung vanities, mirrored cabinets for medicines & cosmetics, walk-in-showers, rainfall showerheads, under-floor heating and heated towel rails. The balcony is accessible both from the lounge room as well as one of the bedrooms. The pleasant shape of the balcony is accentuated by the wrap-around glass balustrade. Enjoying a view of Yerrabi Pond and parkland and lots of morning sunshine, this is a balcony which is certain to get plenty of use.The Ruby complex has some very attractive, resort-style amenities, including several rooftop areas which are also bookable for private functions, a well-appointed gym, several rooftop gardens with barbecues, pizza ovens and outdoor kitchens, as well as a swimming pool with a view, all for the exclusive use of residents and their invited guests.Secure, lock-up car parking is provided in the building basement. Pets are allowed in apartments but not in common areas. This is certainly a very pet-friendly environment. Located in Canberra\u2019s most vibrant and well-connected town centre, this lovely unit is easy walking distance to the light-rail terminus, chic eateries, public library, College, Bunnings, shopping malls & supermarkets, several outlet stores & medical centers.Inclusions:\u2022\tLinen closet\u2022\tAEG dishwasher\u2022\tdog flap/pet door\u2022\tEuropean laundry\u2022\tLarge fridge alcove\u2022\tHigh ceilings (2.55m)\u2022\tFTTP NBN connected\u2022\t2 x 600mm AEG ovens\u2022\t40mm stone benchtops\u2022\t900mm AEG Induction cooktop\u2022\tSoft close drawers & cupboards\u2022\tTwo lockable basement storage sheds\u2022\tFujitsu ducted heating & cooling, serviced annually\u2022\tsheer curtains, black-out drapes, Veri Shades & flyscreensTotal space size: 145 sqmInternal living: 104 sqmBalcony: 11 sqmDo not miss this one.

Resting on an elevated street, handy to Gell Street Pond and Yungaballi Park Playground, moments from the thriving Gungahlin precinct, the home gifts an idyllic lifestyle, a relaxing family ease. Surrounded by pristine reserves and stunning mountain ranges, Moncrieff effortlessly combines an inviting urban lifestyle with the soothing vibes of country living.A unique Japanese flair individuates the home, as timber baton work is left to weather naturally, softening the confidence of the solid rendered walls. Beautifully landscaped gardens enclose the home, as sandstone retaining walls add texture and golden warmth.

Large format ceramic flooring flows underfoot and there are bursts of warm timber throughout, nodding to the natural bush surrounds. A front living space frames leafy views via corner awning windows in striking black steel, that pop against the palette of soft greys, so consistent throughout the home.The master bedroom captures leafy views and benefits from a large walk-in-robe and elegant ensuite bathroom, with double shower and vanity. We love the open timber shelves within the bathroom for display and the full-height tiling in warm organic tones. The clever spatial arrangement that aligns the master bedroom with the intimate living area next door, creates a roomy and private parental retreat if desired. Think, quiet evenings, relaxed adult time, movie nights or gathering with friends, and all without disturbing the sleeping kids.A neatly arranged office nook is finished in a combo of laminated and oak cabinetry and provides an elegant solution to working from home. A white laser cut screen welcomes light and provides peek-a-boo glimpses to the large social arena that lies beyond.The modern kitchen is all chic timelessness, with floating island and waterfall stone benchtop. Fresh concrete marries beautifully with the banks of dove grey cabinetry. While the adjacent butler's pantry takes care of the mess, keeping things sleekly minimal. Honeycomb tiling adorns the splashbacks and quality stainless-steel appliances from Smeg make cooking up family meals or sophisticated dinner parties easy. The family can gather at the island breakfast bar, allowing you to cook and chat and the ideal open sociability makes entertaining a breeze.Glass sliders and clerestory windows flood the combined dining and living area with continuous natural light. There is a recessed alcove for the television and floating oak cabinetry. One imagines the family spilling to outdoor area, the barbecue sizzling as the kids romp on the manicured lawns that wrap around the eastern side of the home, providing plenty of space for play equipment.Three welcoming bedrooms, all with built-in-robes centre around a stunning family bathroom with a tub. Lush grey carpet softens and silences and the whole house is made cosy all year round via ducted reverse cycle air-conditioning.

Vast open spaces and mountain ranges characterise the locale and there are walking trails, ponds and a community centre coming soon. The home is close to the colourful Moncrieff Community Recreation Park which is Canberra's favourite playground!

The Lyneham schools are just across the road and there is a sequence of interconnecting park and wetlands, with shared walking and biking trails that traverse Lyneham and O'Connor, connecting you to the CBD. This whole area is characterised by old growth street trees and an inviting array of independent restaurants, bars and boutiques. Literally everything is at hand, and there is a lovely combo of peaceful privacy and community connection.The building cuts a fine figure, with its classic combo of painted brick, bank of high square windows, Juliette balcony and pattern of protruded bricks. A private driveway on the left-hand side provides plenty of off-street parking. Entry is via the solid original front door with sidelight and insets of lovely vintage bevelled glass.Similar semi-detached duplexes of this era have been lovingly restored, creating light filled homes that drift to sunny rear gardens. There is potential for the adjacent laundry and powder room to be re-jigged as a second bathroom combined laundry, with direct access to outside.The traditional layout houses the bedrooms and family bathroom upstairs, benefiting from the elevated views and a natural privacy. The master bedroom drifts to balcony with a lovely outlook, through the treetops to the green playing fields, that will never be built-out.A later extension has placed two north facing units to the rear, both with separate entry from the street. Notably each of the three units have their own metered power. The additional self-contained units could be opened and linked, to create an expansive four-bedroom family home.

The suburb is bounded by Northbourne Avenue, Antill Street and Philip Avenue.The suburb was gazetted in 1960 and named after Sir John Downer (1844\u20131915) Premier of South Australia and a member of the first Australian Senate in 1901. There is no specific theme for street names.The buildings which make up the Downer community centre and former shops, were built for the CSIRO in 1930s, and the area now comprising Downer was an agricultural research facility for the CSIRO. The area now comprising the suburb was used between 1939\u201345 as a plantation for the growth of opium poppy to provide a source for medications in the unavailability of imported supplies. The large pine and gum trees which surround the block around the shops were planted in this time as a wind break for the CSIRO building. Large trees (Camden Woolybutts) along Swinden street were also planted then, as Swinden street was the driveway for the CSIRO building, where it connected to Northbourne Avenue.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

It is named in honour of Lady Denman GBE, the wife of the fifth Governor-General of Australia, The Right Honorable The Lord Denman. The principal ceremonial occasion during Lady Denman's term as first lady was the inauguration of the Federal capital on 12 March 1913. Lady Denman stood upon the newly laid Foundation Stones and pronounced, \"I name the capital of Australia \u2013 Canberra\". The name Denman Prospect was selected to distinguish the locality from the town of Denman, New South Wales. The use of the suffix 'prospect' meaning view, vision or the outlook for the future, is considered significant in the context of the naming of Canberra by Lady Denman and Lord Denman's ensuing visionary speech for the future of the capital.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

It does not have any suburban houses, consisting only of part of Lake Ginninderra, the Belconnen Naval Transmission Station, and an open area of grassland where there is a reservoir and substation. A bicycle path runs alongside Ginninderra Drive, another along the shore of the lake. The area is surrounded by Baldwin Drive, William Slim Drive and Ginninderra Drive. It lies next to the suburbs of McKellar, Giralang, Kaleen, Bruce and Belconnen.Two intersections were built in 2012 that lead into the suburb's grasslands, prepared for future development on the suburb, one leading off Ginninderra Drive, and another off Baldwin Drive. However, neither intersection continued on further than a few metres. Development was delayed by about two years by Commonwealth environmental clearance processes due to the presence of golden sun moth and native grassland. Construction of roads have commenced and the first residential land was sold on 3 December 2013.The suburb derives its name from Henry Lawson, short story writer and poet. The streets in Lawson are named after aspects of Australia appearing in his writing.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

It is named in honour of Lady Denman GBE, the wife of the fifth Governor-General of Australia, The Right Honorable The Lord Denman. The principal ceremonial occasion during Lady Denman's term as first lady was the inauguration of the Federal capital on 12 March 1913. Lady Denman stood upon the newly laid Foundation Stones and pronounced, \"I name the capital of Australia \u2013 Canberra\". The name Denman Prospect was selected to distinguish the locality from the town of Denman, New South Wales. The use of the suffix 'prospect' meaning view, vision or the outlook for the future, is considered significant in the context of the naming of Canberra by Lady Denman and Lord Denman's ensuing visionary speech for the future of the capital.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

The suburb was gazetted in 1960 and named after Sir John Downer (1844\u20131915) Premier of South Australia and a member of the first Australian Senate in 1901. There is no specific theme for street names.The buildings which make up the Downer community centre and former shops, were built for the CSIRO in 1930s, and the area now comprising Downer was an agricultural research facility for the CSIRO. The area now comprising the suburb was used between 1939\u201345 as a plantation for the growth of opium poppy to provide a source for medications in the unavailability of imported supplies. The large pine and gum trees which surround the block around the shops were planted in this time as a wind break for the CSIRO building. Large trees (Camden Woolybutts) along Swinden street were also planted then, as Swinden street was the driveway for the CSIRO building, where it connected to Northbourne Avenue.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

It is named in honour of Lady Denman GBE, the wife of the fifth Governor-General of Australia, The Right Honorable The Lord Denman. The principal ceremonial occasion during Lady Denman's term as first lady was the inauguration of the Federal capital on 12 March 1913. Lady Denman stood upon the newly laid Foundation Stones and pronounced, \"I name the capital of Australia \u2013 Canberra\". The name Denman Prospect was selected to distinguish the locality from the town of Denman, New South Wales. The use of the suffix 'prospect' meaning view, vision or the outlook for the future, is considered significant in the context of the naming of Canberra by Lady Denman and Lord Denman's ensuing visionary speech for the future of the capital.Disclaimer:Please note that while all care has been taken regarding general information and marketing information compiled for this rental advertisement, LJ HOOKER CANBERRA CITY does not accept responsibility and disclaim all liabilities in regard to any errors or inaccuracies contained herein.

    "description": "Views on Candlagan\nPID-STRA-28767With absolute water frontage, the house is on Mossy Pt headland overlooking the surf and sand of one of NSW's finest beaches. Built in 1978 by a Danish architect and his Aussie mate, it is the country's first solar passive house. Its design has an indoor/outdoor ambiance to capture the beauty of the natural environment. In the summer months the roof is sealed against the heat, but the house has a thermal chimney through its centre to draw in the cooling sea breezes. In winter, the glass walls and windows flood the place with light and warmth.

Owned by the same family for over 50 years the house has been their exclusive holiday destination for 5 generations. It's now your chance to see why they came from all over Australia and the rest of the world just to stay here and never wanted to leave.The Break-Away Beach House is a classic 1960's beach house over two levels with a few more recent modifications to bring it up date. It was designed to accommodate two or three generations of the same family at the same time so it has 3 separate sleeping compounds for its 5 bedrooms and two separate living spaces. A family can be together under the one roof but not be under each others feet.The accommodation on the first floor includes two separate bedrooms; the master with a queen bed and incredible views of the beach, surf and distant headlands and the second smaller bedroom, a double bed. There is a full modern bathroom no bath plus a modern kitchen, with dishwasher, microwave and double wall oven living/ dining room and enclosed verandah. The views from the living room and enclosed verandah are spectacular. You can literally sit in the lounge room and watch the kids playing on the beach across the road. Adjoining the verandah is a large open deck with a gas BBQ. The deck enjoys fabulous views of the beach and the park like garden at the rear of the property. The deck is well lit for night time entertaining.The ground floor of the house includes a large bedroom with king bed which unzips to form two singles plus a separate single bed. It has its own external access and is separated from the rest of the house by the large adjacent living room. On the other side of the ground floor there are two smaller bedrooms each with two single beds, a bathroom no bath and large laundry. One of the smaller bedrooms also acts as access to the bathroom and laundry so is less private.The house has been modified to make it more comfortable for elderly residents. The shower in the first floor bathroom is fitted with a hand shower, a pull down seat and hand rails and the toilet has hand rails fitted on the adjacent wall. However the only access between the ground floor and the first floor is via stairs.In addition to being just meters from the best surfing beach on the south coast, the Break-Away Beach House is set in approximately one acre of manicured park like native garden. The garden is level and filled with native birds and wildflowers. You can enjoy your own private picnics or just relax, read a book and take in the beauty of of this most incredible space. it truly is and oasis of calm.The Break-Away Beach House is a dog friendly house no cats. We allow a maximum of 2 small to medium dogs or one large dog. They must be house trained, not aggressive, clean and well behaved. The house has a fenced area connected to the laundry on the ground floor and a fully enclosed balcony on the first floor. Dogs must not be left unattended either in the house, on the balcony or in the garden at any time and simple house rules must be observed at all times. Guests must take full responsibility including the cost of cleaning up after or repairing any damage caused by your dogs. Tathra beach is mostly dog friendly, with plenty of local walks and parks in the area. Before visiting the area dog owners should seek advice on appropriate treatment for paralysis ticks.",
